The original plugin "[URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=77391"]Galileo[/URL]" is originally written by [B]Brad[/B]. The "Galileo Reload" works similarly 
as the original "[B]Galileo[/B]". But "[B][COLOR="Blue"]Galileo Reloaded[/COLOR][/B]" has special features for the "[URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=273020"]Multi-Mod Manager[/URL]" plugin, but it 
still can be used alone. See the [goanchor=Change]Change Log[/goanchor] and [goanchor=Credits]Credits[/goanchor] for more info. 

This is a Alpha version. This Alpha software can be unstable, see [goanchor=TODO]TODO[/goanchor] section for more information. 
As [B]Alpha software[/B] may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version, see [goanchor=TODO]TODO[/goanchor] 
section for features that are planned for the final version. It is tested under [B]Counter-Strike[/B] and Counter-Strike: [B]Condition Zero[/B].

A lot of time and effort went into making this plugin, making features just right, 
making sure there were no bugs, making sure it was easy to use. If you are glad I made
