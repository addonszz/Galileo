Was tried the best to let this plugin to be 100% equivalent to its orignal version. Such thing
isn't impossible or very hard. But as was every original code was broken apart, this could let
something sideways. This plugin is jumping from version '1.2.2' to '2.0.1' because there are
major coding changes and new features.

Here you can find an easter egg from Brad:
[URL="https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Galileo"] https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Galileo[/URL]

It is a good start to use it within this new version, but as just it do not cover all current
features, see this whole thread and the "[B]galileo.cfg[/B]" file contents for full speficiation.

The original plugin [URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=77391"]Galileo[/URL] is written by [B]Brad[/B]. This Galileo works as the original [B]Galileo[/B].
Moreover this [B][COLOR="Blue"]Galileo[/COLOR][/B] has also special features for the [URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=273020"]Multi-Mod Manager[/URL] plugin and
it stills can be used all alone. See the [goanchor=Change]Change Log[/goanchor] and [goanchor=Credits]Credits[/goanchor] for more details.

********************** [anchor]Brief[/anchor][SIZE="5"][COLOR="Blue"][B]Small / Brief Features' list:[/B][/COLOR][/SIZE] [goanchor=Top]Go to top[/goanchor] ******
[QUOTE]
[LIST=1]
 [*] Ability to "[B]rock the vote[/B]".

 
 [*] Map [B]nominations[/B] to be used in the next map vote.

 
 [*] [B]Runoff[/B] voting when no map gets more than 50% of the total vote.

 
 [*] Auto Map Change [B]On Empty Server[/B].

 
 [*] [B]Nominate[/B] Map List Menu.

 
 [*] Allow last round finish when the map the [B]time runs out[/B].
 
 
 [*] To ask the players before the voting begins, if they [B]want to[/B] participate the map
     voting [COLOR="blue"]to decide[/COLOR] which next map will be played. See the cvar 'gal_endofmapvote_ask'.
 
 
 [*] After the user voted, transform the '[B]0 - None[/B]' option to an '[COLOR="blue"]one time cancel[/COLOR]' vote
     opportunity, configured by cvar.

 
 [*] Command '[COLOR="Blue"][B]gal_startvote -nochange or -restart[/B][/COLOR]', to forces a map vote to begin 
     and the map will be changed once the next map has been determined. 
            
            
            [LIST]
            [*]If the "[COLOR="blue"][B]-nochange[/B][/COLOR]" argument is supplied, the map will not be changed by
            [COLOR="Blue"]Galileo[/COLOR], which is useful when you have a different plugin handling the actual
            changing of the map.
            
            
            [*]If the "[COLOR="blue"][B]-restart[/B][/COLOR]" argument is supplied and the voting opting "Stay Here" wins,
            the current map is restarted. This command is for the "[URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=273020"]Multi-Mod Manager[/URL]"
            plugin.
            [/LIST]
            
            
 [*] Command '[COLOR="Blue"][B]gal_createmapfile filename[/B][/COLOR]', Creates a file that contains a list of every
     valid map in your maps folder. The [B]filename[/B] argument indicates specifies the name
     to be used for the new file.  It will be created in the [COLOR="Blue"][B]./configs/galileo/[/B][/COLOR] folder.
 
 
 [*] [COLOR="Blue"][B]The Map Groups Feature[/B][/COLOR]:
     It uses whatever file you have set in the cvar '[B]gal_vote_mapfile[/B]'. Normally, in that
     file you would just have a listing of maps, one per line. But to use the groups feature,
     your '[B]gal_vote_mapfile[/B]' cvar would point to a '.txt' file looking something like this
     instead:
     [CODE]
[groups]
2
1
1
3
     [/CODE]The text "[groups]" has to be the very first line in the file, on a line by itself. The
     numbers, on separate lines, specifies how many maps from each file to add to the
     voting menu.
     
     If you had a file within what was posted above, then you would have to create the
     files: '[B]1.ini[/B]', '[B]2.ini[/B]', '[B]3.ini[/B]', and '[B]4.ini[/B]' in the '[B]./configs/galileo/[/B]' folder. Each of
     those INI files would contain a list of maps, one per line.
     
     Galileo will first load any nominated maps into the vote. Then Galileo would pick 2
     maps from '[B]1.ini[/B]', 1 from '[B]2.ini[/B]', 1 from '[B]3.ini[/B]', and 3 from '[B]4.ini[/B]' 'til the maximum
     value of 8 to be reached.
     
     [B]Another example[/B]:
     If you want to always show the map '[COLOR="Blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' on the map voting, just use:
     [CODE]
[groups]
1
7
     [/CODE]This maps groups configuration means to load [COLOR="red"]up to 1 map[/COLOR] from the file '[B]1.ini[/B]'
     (1? line after [groups]) and [COLOR="red"]up to 7 maps[/COLOR] from '[B]2.ini[/B]' (2? line after [groups]).

     Then you only need to create the files '[B]1.ini[/B]' and '[B]2.ini[/B]' in the '[B]./configs/galileo/[/B]'
     folder. And in the file '[B]1.ini[/B]' you put only the '[COLOR="Blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' map, and in the file '[B]2.ini[/B]'
     you put your mapcycle or voting filler maps file list.

     Hence the map '[COLOR="Blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' will always be available on any voting. It only will not be
     displayed, if and only if, the nominations are enabled and there are [COLOR="Blue"][B]1 + 7[/B][/COLOR] map
     nominations and none of them is '[COLOR="blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]'. The map '[COLOR="Blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' will not be loaded
     on this case because the maximum maps available on any voting is [COLOR="Blue"][B]1 + 7 = 8[/B][/COLOR].
     And as the map nominations are loaded before filling the map voting list using the
     map fillers from your map groups files '[B]1.ini[/B]' (1? line after [groups]) and '[B]2.ini[/B]'
     (2? line after [groups]), the map '[COLOR="blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' will not be added because there is not
     enough space.
     
     
 [*] [COLOR="Blue"][B]The mapcycle whitelist[/B][/COLOR]:
     If uses whatever file you set on the cvar '[B]gal_vote_whitelist_mapfile[/B]' as the
     mapcycle whitelist. It specifies the time where its listed maps are allowed to be
     added to the voting list as fillers after the [B]nominations[/B] being loaded.
     
     The whitelist must follow this pattern:
     [CODE]
[10-22]
de_dust2
de_inferno

[23-05]
de_tuscan_mgc
de_mirage

[05-10]
de_dust2_long
     [/CODE] The maps following '[B][10-22][/B]' will be only allowed to be vote map fillers between
     10:00 and 22:00 o'clock. This feature should be helpful because some servers have
     about only 10 players between 05:00 and 10:00 o'clock, so they will be needing [COLOR="Blue"]small
     maps[/COLOR] for playing.

[/LIST]

[B]2009-02-26 | v1.1.290[/B]
[LIST=1]
[*]Added a check for valid map when populating the various map listings from map list files.
[*]Fixed error whem empty server map file doesn't exist.
[*]Fixed issue whereas Galileo would set the time limit to 0 in the course of it's regular
activities but then sometimes not reset it to the original time limit afterwards.
[*]No longer tries to print menus in color if the game mod doesn't support colored menus.
[*]Fixed possible RTV exploit by introducing a delay before a single player can RTV after a
 map change. It's the lesser of either 2 minutes or the value of gal_rtv_wait.
[*]Added additional information to comments for gal_nom_mapfile, gal_vote_mapfile, and
 gal_emptyserver_mapfile in galileo.cfg.
[*]Changed default for gal_nom_prefixes from 1 to 0. In other words, the prefix functionality
 will be turned off by default.
[*]Will no longer overwrite an existing menu. This means if a player has another menu open when
the map vote starts, they won't see the map vote until the other menu is closed. It also means
that, after a player voted and if the server is showing the vote progress, if another menu
overwrites Galileo's, the progress won't be shown again until the other menu has been closed.
This only affects people that show the in-progress vote status.
[*]Now obeys a setting of "0" for gal_endofmapvote. Would previously erroneously present a vote
regardless of the setting.
[*]New CVAR, gal_sounds_mute, to indicate if any of the sentences spoken during various events are
muted. See galileo.cfg for more information.
[*]Added code to handle automated version info from SVN. This is of no consequence to anyone but
me really, but I wanted to include it in the change log since it actually involves a change
to the code.
[*]Removed benign code that was prepped for feature utilizing standard maps of each mod. There
is no longer any plans to add any information regarding standard maps as I see no use for it.
[*]Removed the following language keys:
GAL_STANDARD_NOTFOUND
GAL_STANDARD_TOOMANY
GAL_STANDARD_UNKNOWNMOD
[*]Fixed the "vote filler groups" feature that was previously working incorrectly.

[QUOTE=azure;11799]hrrmm this is very interesting. Could I set this up to change the mapcycle possibly?

like have mapcycle 1 from 9 till 23 and then mapcycle2 from 23 til 9?

[*]gal_vote_minplayers_mapfile
[*]gal_nom_mapfile
[*]gal_emptyserver_mapfile[/LIST]To use another mapcycle files which does not contain the maps you do not want to use by early hours.
